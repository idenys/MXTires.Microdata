//Note: You can use minValue and maxValue to indicate ranges.
//dateVehicleFirstRegistered	Date 	The date of the first registration of the vehicle with the respective public authorities.
//driveWheelConfiguration	Text  or 
//DriveWheelConfigurationValue 	The drive wheel configuration, i.e. which roadwheels will receive torque from the vehicle's engine via the drivetrain.
//fuelConsumption	QuantitativeValue 	The amount of fuel consumed for traveling a particular distance or temporal duration with the given vehicle (e.g. liters per 100 km).
//Note 1: There are unfortunately no standard unit codes for liters per 100 km.
//Use unitText to indicate the unit of measurement, e.g. L/100 km. Note 2: There are two ways of indicating the fuel consumption, fuelConsumption (e.g. 8 liters per 100 km) and fuelEfficiency (e.g. 30 miles per gallon). They are reciprocal.
//Note 3: Often, the absolute value is useful only when related to driving speed ("at 80 km/h") or usage pattern ("city traffic"). You can use valueReference to link the value for the fuel consumption to another value.
//fuelEfficiency	QuantitativeValue 	The distance traveled per unit of fuel used; most commonly miles per gallon (mpg) or kilometers per liter (km/L).
//Note 1: There are unfortunately no standard unit codes for miles per gallon or kilometers per liter.
//Use unitText to indicate the unit of measurement, e.g. mpg or km/L. Note 2: There are two ways of indicating the fuel consumption, fuelConsumption (e.g. 8 liters per 100 km) and fuelEfficiency (e.g. 30 miles per gallon). They are reciprocal.
//Note 3: Often, the absolute value is useful only when related to driving speed ("at 80 km/h") or usage pattern ("city traffic"). You can use valueReference to link the value for the fuel economy to another value.
